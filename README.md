# COSI153
final project for cosi153

## Title
Preview a Palette with standard DMC embroidery colors

## Description
Inside the app subdirectory of my COSI153 repository is the final version of my app for COSI 153-Mobile App Development. It allows you to add and clear colors from a palette, and view a preview of that palette.

My next order of business is to refine the storage system, so that the user can save their palette (and eventually have multiple pallettes).

Eventually, I would like to add a cross stitch pattern making mechanism. So people can make patterns on their phones, and then view them there as well. So if they have a question about what color is in a specicific square they can look closer and be certain.

## How to Install
1. Clone repository / or download as a zip
2. Change to the correct directory and type `expo start`

## How to Use
The main purpose of the app so far is to create a palette, you can choose a color category from typing in a basic color (options: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, white, grey, black). Then the page will show all the DMC threads classified as that color, if typed incorrectly no colors will appear. Then you can add the color you want to your palette. The color will pop up under the "Preview Palette" header so you can see how the colors you choose will look together.
