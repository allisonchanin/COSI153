# COSI153

Inside the app subdirectory of my COSI153 repository is the final version of my app for COSI 153-Mobile App Development. It allows you to add and delete colors from a palette, and view a preview of that palette.

My next order of business is to complete the database of colors, so that the user can choose from any of the DMC thread colors.

Eventually, I would like to add a cross stitch pattern making mechanism. So people can make patterns on their phones, and then view them there as well. So if they have a question about what color is in a specicific square they can look closer and be certain.
