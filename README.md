# COSI153

Inside the app subdirectory is the final version of my app for COSI 153 Mobile App Development. It allows you to add and delete colors from a palette, and view a preview of that palette.

Eventually, I would like to add a cross stitch pattern making mechanism. So people can make patterns on their phones, and then view them there as well.
So if they have a question about what color is in a specicific square they can look closer and be certain.
